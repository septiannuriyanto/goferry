Flutter project designed to solve real-world problems<br>
Designed, coded, and maintained by Septian Nuriyanto

## Introduction

Hi, my name is Septian.<br>
I've been working in the coal mining industry for 11 years in the Supply Chain Management Department. So many things going around in material management. Managing goods is like several knowledge applications combined. However, hundreds of thousands of dollars invested by the company, so we cannot mess around with the poor quality of the material management system.<br><br>

## Problem
As one of the biggest mining service companies in Indonesia, we regularly ordered supplies from various cities on Borneo island to provide the logistics needed for our project.</br></br>
Unfortunately, since 6th June 2023, Sambaliung Bridge has been shut down due to maintenance. Therefore, it causes a negative impact on our logistics activity. On the other hand, we have to maintain the process so that the project won't stop because of the bridge shutdown. </br>So, as an alternative solution we made an agreement with one of our vendors to provide the LCT so that our trucks from other cities are able to cross to the other side and deliver our goods.</br></br>

## Goals
However, to rent an LCT is not a cheap solution. Anyway, it's still considered the best solution due to the geographical issue.</br>
As a matter of price, we have to maintain the register of the truck so we can get the actual and accurate data based on how many trucks arrived at our project site. Because at the end of the month, our vendor will send us an invoice, and we will cross-check with our data. That's why I made this app.


## Outline
This app is produced with the flutter framework, with some functionality planned to be built now (or later) including :
