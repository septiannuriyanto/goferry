Web Monitoring App to Register Freight that uses the LCT Service from our vendor

## Getting Started

As one of a biggest mining service company in Indonesia, we regularly ordered supplies from various city in borneo island to provide logistics need for our project.</br></br>
Unfortunately since 6th June 2023, Sambaliung bridge is shut down due to maintenance. Therefore, it causes a negative impact to our logistics activity. 

In the other hand, we have to maintain the process so that the project won't stop because of the bridge shutdown. </br>So, as an alternative solution we made an agreement with one of our vendor to provide the LCT so that our trucks from other cities able to cross to the other side and deliver our goods.</br></br>
However, renting an LCT is not a cheap solution. Anyway, it's still considered as a best solution due to the geographical issue.</br>
As a matter of price, we have to maintain the register of the truck so we got the actual and accurate data based on how many trucs arrived at our project site. Because at the end of the month, our vendor will send us an invoice, and we got cross-check with our data. That's why I made this app.
</br></br>
This app is a real use case and is to be implemented for monitoring truck registering which uses LCT service.
